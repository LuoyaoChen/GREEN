Interstitial opacities without changes.,Interstitial opacities at bases without changes.,"
The candidate report is largely consistent with the reference report. However, it specifies the location of the interstitial opacities as being at the bases, which is not mentioned in the reference report. This could be considered a clinically insignificant error as it does not change the overall diagnosis or treatment plan, but it is an additional detail not present in the reference report.

The candidate report is significantly different from the reference report. It does not mention any of the findings from the reference report, such as the removal of the endotracheal and nasogastric tubes, the changes of median sternotomy, the leftward displacement of the fourth inferomost sternal wire, the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, the slight improvement of pulmonary aeration, and the residual left lower lobe atelectasis. Instead, it reports on the development of segmental heterogeneous airspace opacities throughout the lungs, which is not mentioned in the reference report.

The candidate report has several discrepancies when compared to the reference report. The candidate report mentions the development of segmental heterogeneous airspace opacities throughout the lungs, which is not mentioned in the reference report.

The candidate report includes several findings that are not mentioned in the reference report, such as the removal of endotracheal and nasogastric tubes, changes in the sternotomy, enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, and left lower lobe atelectasis. These are clinically significant errors as they are false reports of findings. The candidate report also misassesses the severity of the bilateral pleural effusions, describing them as ""big"" instead of ""small"" as in the reference report. This is a clinically significant error as it misrepresents the severity of the finding.
